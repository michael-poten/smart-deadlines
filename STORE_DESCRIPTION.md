*Smart Deadlines* can be used to distribute estimations on cards over appointments in your iCal-Calendar. The calculated dates are set as due date in the given cards of the list. 

The origin iCal-Calendar is only imported and will never be changed!

## What happens there exactly?

After entering the URL to your iCal calendar in the preferences and setting estimates per card, you can calculate the due dates for a list calculated automatically. First, all dates (with the previously defined title) for the next 3 months are read from your iCal calendar. Afterwards, the next possible date is determined for each card in sequence according to the estimate and set as due date.

## A small example

**User estimates**

Card A: 1 hour

Card B: 1,5 hours

Card C: 1 hour

**Dates according to calendar**

16.8.2020 / 10 - 12 o'clock

16.8.2020 / 15 - 17 o'clock

**Calculated due dates**

Card A: 10:00 o'clock

Card B: 11:00 o'clock

Card C: 15:30 o'clock
