# Your personal data

### What data do we collect

At this time we do not collect any personally identifiable data. We temporarily load calendar appointments, but they are never stored.

### What do we use your data for

We use the calendar appointments to calculate the due dates.

### How do we protect your data

Calendar appointments are never stored and all calculations are performed in your browser. A third-party service is used to download the iCal data ("https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com"). This is necessary to avoid conflicts with specially configured iCal-Services. The data is otherwise only be shared where legally required.

### How long do we keep your data

We never store any data about you.

# Policy updates

### Will we ever change our data collection policy

We might change our future collection practises regarding personally identifiable data for the purpose of providing features that would not be feasible without said data.

We will change our collection practises regarding basic connection data as required by the operation of the service. We will report any substantial changes of the policy that might affect your use of said service as part of this policy.

### How will we engage you if our policy changes

Since we are not collecting any personally identifiable information, we do not have any means to personally inform you about policy changes. All changes to our current policy will be posted to this document; recent policy changes will be highlighted.

Should we change our policy regarding collecting personally identifiable information, the policy regarding informing you about said changes will change accordingly.
