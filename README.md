# Smart Deadlines

The [Trello](https://trello.com/) Power-Up 'Smart Deadlines' can be used to distribute estimations on cards over appointments in your iCal-Calendar. The calculated dates are set as due date in the given cards of the list. 

**Important: The origin iCal-Calendar is only imported and will never be changed.**

- Import this repository.
- Follow the instructions on trello.com to create an account.
- In the trello.com setting, you add the URL from the live server.
